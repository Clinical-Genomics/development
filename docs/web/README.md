# Web development

The state of web development in 2017 is notoriously messy. As a beginner, try not to get bogged down in all the options presented to you. The basis for any of the frameworks, build systems, pre/post-processors, and language flavors is pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript - also referred to as HTML5. The [HTML & CSS guide][html-guide] from *Interneting is Hard* looks like a great starting point even for the absolute beginner!

## Bootstrap

For the frontend, we use [Bootstrap][bootstrap] and moving towards [Bootstrap 4][bootstrap-4]. It's a comprehensive framework with defaults, components, and grid system etc.
