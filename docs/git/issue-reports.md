# User stories

User stories are short, simple descriptions of a feature told from the perspective of the person who desires the new capability, usually a user or customer of the system. They typically follow a simple template:

> As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >.1

As the name suggests, a user story describes how a customer or user employs the product; it is told from the userâ€™s perspective.2

## A suggested minimum description:

Title:

- Problem description
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected outcome / suggested solution
- Questions answered
- Add label *PBL Teamname*
- Estimated

## Title

Describe the issue in a sentence that summarises the wanted outcome
- Example: Clinical-Genomics - Failing login gives me understandable feedback  

## Steps to reproduce

Describe the steps that are needed to provoke the encountered issue so that anyone can reproduce the issue.
Any special circumstances that you think is affecting the outcome should be described (e.g. environment/browser etc.)
Example:
1. Go to Clinical-Genomics in production environment (https://clinical.scilifelab.se) with a web browser
1. Press "Sign in with Google"
1. Select any of your accounts that don't have access to the system

The aim is to guide the reader towards the problem without having to spend any time on figuring out how or
having to communicate with the issue reporter on what to do to provoke the system in order to reproduce the issue.

## Expected outcome

Describe the expected output so that is clear what the goal state is. The aim is to know when issue is resolved.

- Example: A red toast message saying: This account is not whitelisted

## Actual outcome

Describe what happened when the Steps to reproduce where followed. The aim is to guide the reader towards the root of
the problem. (E.g. Is it something that relates to this specific user or something general).

- Example: There is no message at all about what went wrong when I tried to login

> A screenshot of the outcome can often be of great help for the reader to understand what you see
