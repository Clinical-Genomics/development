# Introduction

This is a software development guide.

## Getting started

If you are new to this repository we want to get you started right away! Please have a look at one of the [assignments](assignments/README.md).

## Setup

This section described how to setup the repo for development. To preview changes in the finished format you need [mkdocs][mkdocs]. If you are using [conda][conda] you should be able to run:

```bash
conda create -n D_mkdocs
pip install mkdocs
# now you should be able to run
mkdocs --help
# to preview changes in a browser, navigate to the repo and run:
mkdocs serve
```

You can read more in the official [GitBook Toolchain documentation][gb-toolchain].
