is a software development guide.\nGetting started\nIf you are new to this repository we want to get you started right away! Please have a look at one of the assignments.\nSetup\nThis section described how to setup the repo for development. To preview changes in the finished format you need the GitBook CLI. To run it you need to install Node.js and NPM. If you are using conda you should be able to run:\nconda install -c conda-forge nodejs\n# that line installs both `node` and `npm`\nnpm install -g gitbook-cli\n# now you should be able to run\ngitbook help\n# to preview changes in a browser, navigate to the repo and run:\ngitbook serve\n\nYou can read more in the official GitBook Toolchain documentation.\n"},"documentation/":{"url":"documentation/","title":"Documentation","keywords":"","body":"Documentation\nYour project documentation will inevitably be the most important part of your project going forward. It's important to use any and all means at your disposal to document your code.\nWe like to write documentation in Markdown using GitBook. It provides a very nice command line interface, free static hosting, and a nice default theme with integrated search. This site is generated using GitBook!\nWe focus on providing online prose documentation with tutorials and examples.\nDedicated documentation\nThis is likely the main entry point for new users. The dedicated documentation should first and foremost provide a higher level description of the software. It's important to give a gentle introduction but still get to the point the point quickly.\nIt should be available online, either as part a README file for small projects or more likely a full web site. Liberally include code examples and if possible a short demo tutorial where the user can follow along.\nAPI documentation (Python)\nPython provides many powerful alternatives for inline documentation. We prefer a combination of docstring to explain the purpose of individual classes/methods/function with extensive type annotations. We prefer explicit type annotations over e.g. [Google style docstrings][google-docstrings] since they provide a richer syntax, allow editors to provide useful auto-completions, and will probably make you think twice before breaking.\nThat said, here's an example of inline Python documentation, using docstrings:\n@curry\ndef grep(pattern, line):\n    \"\"\"Match a simple pattern substring in a given string.\n\n    Note that the function would also work to check for an item in a list,\n    a key in a dictionary etc.\n\n    Args:\n        pattern (str): substring to match with\n        line (str): string to match against\n\n    Returns:\n        bool: if ``pattern`` was a substring in ``string``\n\n    Examples:\n        >>> directors = ['Quentin Tarantino', 'PT Anderson']\n        >>> list(filter(grep('Anderson'), directors))\n        ['PT Anderson']\n    \"\"\"\n    return pattern in line\n\nFind out [how to document functions][google-docstrings] in your language and stick to accepted conventions.\nChange log\nFollow this opinionated standard dubbed \"Keep a CHANGELOG\". Basically it should be written in Markdown, mark each release with a version and date, and clearly separate between different categories of changes.\nFlowcharts\nFlowcharts can convey overview in ways that is impossible to put into words. It can be a great way to organize e.g. a pipeline of functions that will help you in the design of your project. My favorite software is the free and online tool Kingfisher.\n"},"git/":{"url":"git/","title":"Git","keywords":"","body":"Quick reference guide to Github\n\n1. Purpose\n2. Download and setup\n2.1 Download and install Git for Linux.\n2.2 Download and install Git for OSX.\n2.3 Download and install Git under Windows.\n\n\n3. Configure username and email.\n4.

Create a pull request to the parent repository.\n11. Github usage references\n12. How to write Github documentation\n\n1. Purpose\nThis document offers an overview of the most important commands of Github and it is intended to be a quick start guide to work with Github repositories.\n2. Download and setup\n2.1 Download and install Git for Linux.\nIf you are working on a Debian-based version of Linux you can install the basic Git tools via APT:\n\n$ sudo apt-get install git-all\n\n\nHere are instructions on how to install Git under other Linux distributions.\n2.2 Download and install Git for OSX.\nThe latest version of Git for Mac can be downloaded here, use this binary installer to get an up-to date version of he software.\nIf you are installing on a Mac with OS X 10.9 you can install Git from command line with Homebrew (get Homebrew here) by typing:\n\nbrew install git\n\n\n2.3 Download and install Git under Windows.\nYou can download an installer of Git for Windows from here or one of the dedicated projects like this or this.\n3. Configure username and email.\nThe first time you are using git from command line you should set up a username and a password. Type in the following commands:\n\ngit config --global user.email \"you@example.com\"\ngit config --global user.name \"YourUsername\"\n\n\n4. Create a new repository.\n4.1 Create a new repository from scratch.\nCreate a directory with the name of the new repository and enter it from command line. To initialize the repository type:\n\ngit init\n\n\n\nThis command will create a .git subfolder containing all the necessary files for your project.\n4.2 Clone a repository from an existing project.\nWhen you are contributing to an existing repository, the first thing you should do is forking this repository to your space. A fork is basically a copy of the original project, on which you can experiment as much as you want without changing the original project.\nAfter forking a repository from the internet (how to fork a repository) you can create a local copy of it from command line, by moving in the parent folder of your new repository, then typing:\n\ngit clone username@host:/path/to/repository\n\n\nWhere username@host:/path/to/repository is the url which can be obtained from the web page of your local fork, by clicking on the \"clone or download\" green button.\nThe git clone command then creates a folder with the project and pulls the latest data from your fork in it.\n\n  For instance, to clone this repository from your fork:\n  git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/development.git\n\n\n\n5. Git data transport structure and commands.\nThe following image shows the structure of the git commands and spaces:\n\n  \n\nYour workspace is the folder that holds the actual working files while the \"index\" is the space is a staging area where you add your changes before committing them to the local repository or \"head\". To send the changes to your remote repository you use the \"push\" command.\nHere is a link to a page explaining the common Git terminology: https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/\n6. Keep your fork up to date.\nBefore committing and pushing changes to your remote repository you should check that you are working on an updated version of it. To update your fork follow these instructions:\nFirst you need to get the latest version of the original project you forked from.\nTo do so, from command line move to the main folder containing your project and type:\n\ngit remote add upstream path/to/repo/you/forked/from\ngit fetch upstream\ngit pull upstream master\ngit pull upstream develop (develop it's the version you start from for your work!)\n\n\nYou don't have to call the remote \"upstream\" but you can chose any name for it. To visualize all remotes you are working with and their respective shortnames use the command:\n\ngit remote -v\n\n\n\nTo remove remotes instead, use the command \"git remove rm\":\n\ngit remote rm name_of_remote\n\n\nAfter pulling data from the remote your local copy of the repo should be up-to-date with the upstream. Now you need to update your fork (the copy existing online, in GitHub) accordingly.\nIf you wish to update you master branch on your fork, sor instance, you'd type these commands:\n\ngit checkout master        #be sure to place yourself in your master branch\ngit rebase upstream/master\ngit push\n\n\nYou use the same commands to update any other branch of your forked repository.\n7. Create a new branch/feature for your work.\nTo create a new branch, from command line move to the main folder containing your project and type:\n\ngit branch -b name_of_the_new_branch\n\n\nTo create a new feature from the develop branch, instead, type:\n\ngit checkout -b name_of_your_feature develop\n\n\nIf everything went fine than you'll get the following message: \"Switched to a new branch name_of_your_feature\". This means you are already inside the new feature. To make sure that you are in the right branch type:\n\ngit branch\n\n\nWhenever you want to move to another branch/feature the command is:\n\ngit checkout -b [my-topic]\n\n\n8. Make changes and commit them to your local repository.\nBefore committing any changes to your local repository, and finally to the remote repository, make sure you were working on a feature created from an updated version of the develop branch (see point 6: Keep your fork up to date).\nAfter you are satisfied with your code you can start to commit to the remote repository.\nTo check that there are actually changes to add and commit, type:\n\ngit status\n\n\nThis command will give you info on the status of your working directory comparing it with the local and remote repositories.\nTo update the local repository to the latest status, by fetchin and merging remote changes, type:\n\ngit pull\n\n\nThe you can start adding your changes to the index with the command:\n\ngit add fileName_to_send_to_index\n\n\nThe process of adding a file to the index is also called staging. Be sure to add all the files you want to include to the index.\nBefore merging the changes you can preview them with the command:\n\ngit diff source_branch target_branch\n\n\nCalling the \"diff\" command without arguments will list all the differences between the index and your workspace, i.e. all the files that you could add to the index.\nTo commit changes from the index to the local repository (HEAD), type:\n\ngit commit\n\n\nAlternatively you can add and commit the files to the local repository in only one command:\n\ngit commit -a\n\n\nNOTE: Be very careful with the above command, since it gives you less control over the single steps of the workflow and the files you really want to commit.\nBefore using it, make sure everything is under control by using the \"git status\" and \"git diff\" commands.\n9. Pushing changes to your remote repository.\nAfter \"git add\" and \"git commit\", or \"commit -a\", your changes are in the HEAD of your local repository. To send them to the remote repository use the command \"push\":\n\ngit push origin (or branch_you_want_to_push_to)\n\n\nNOTE: If your remote, called origin, is configured and you're committing to master, you can omit the word \"origin\" and just type \"git push\".\n10. Create a pull request to the parent repository.\nYou create a \"pull request\" when you want to propose the introduction of your changes to the repository where your project was forked from. Pull requests are created from the webpage of your remote repository. By default pull requests are directed to the default branch of the parent repository, so make sure to use properly the drop-down menu on the webpage to pull changes to the develop branch and not the master branch of the parent repository. For a more detailed explanation of pull requests visit the Github help page.\nOnce the pull request is merged and closed you can safely remove the branch you've been working on.\nto remove a generic branch both remotely and locally type:\n\ngit branch -d name_of_your_branch                #removes it locally\ngit push origin --delete name_of_your_branch     #removes it remotely\n\n\n\n11. Github usage references\nGithub short guide: (https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)\nGithub book:        (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2)\nGitHub help page:   (https://help.github.com/)\nGlossary:           (https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/)\n12. How to write Github documentation\nMarkdown is the documentation format of choice for code on GitHub. If you want to live-preview files in the format they will show up before pushing you can use the handy Grip tool. It super easy to use! All you need to do is:\n\npip install grip\n# cd to your project directory\ngrip\n# open your web-browser at http://localhost:6419\n\n\n"},"git/code-review.html":{"url":"git/code-review.html","title":"Code Review","keywords":"","body":"Code review\nCode reviews exist to spot mistakes that were overlooked during initial development. They are also an excellent opportunity for spreading knowledge and best practices among your team members.\nI've basically stolen all of this from Thoughbot's guide on Code Review.\n\nEstablish the idea that everybody gets reviewed. No one stands above the rest. Every patch gets reviewed. However small, there is no valid argument to not review it.\nAs far as possible, code should be reviewed before it gets merged.\nMake liberal use of GitHub and pull requests; use line-specific comments for example.\nFor bigger patches, don't be afraid to ask to separate them into smaller units.\nDocument code review practices.\n\nRole: Reviewer\nThe reviewer should focus on things in this order:\n\nIntent (why)\nDesign (how)\nImplementation\nGrammar\n\nCollect the suggested changes in TODO lists, questions for the code author, and suggested follow-ups for later patches.\nWorkflow\nWe are on a bi-weekly schedule with 2 pull request responsibles. Their job is to review all pull requests that are requested to be merged and put into production.\nThe person reviewing the code signs off on the pull request with a \"👍\" or simliar and then merges the code.\n\nHot fixes are excluded from code reviews and can be merged by the author herself.\n\nAutomate the automatable\nAim to discover mistakes as early as possible. This includes running lints, checking for conformance to style guide, etc. Encourage team members to run these tools locally as well as considering them as part of your continuous integration flow. It can also be worth mentioning that it's often easier to take criticism from computers rather than your peers.\n"},"python/":{"url":"python/","title":"Python","keywords":"","body":"Python\nPython is a popular and easy-to-learn interpreted programming language. To get a feel for the language, take a look at this comprehensive reference. With the surge in adoption of the most recent version of Python we are encouraging all new code to support Python 3 first and foremost.\nSeparate topics\n\nTesting\nLogging\n\nStyle guide\nWe generally follow PEP8. Written code should pass linting using PyLint. Ignored rules include:\n\nE501: \"wrap lines at 80 characters\" => we use a 100 character limit\n\nLinting code\nA linter is a great way to ensure you are writing code of good quality; following best practices and without avoidable errors relating to missing imports and misspelled variable names. We recommend PyLint for working with Python code. You can set it up to run in the background when you edit code.\nPackaging\nPackaging Python code is a known pain point that many developers struggle with. There are some moves to standardize the experience but for now a great place to start would be to follow this guide. It will give you an idea of the minimal structure you need and beyond.\nFor detailed information or if you need to look up specific options there a very detailed resource available as well.\nWe should be using Pipfile, pipenv.\nConda setup\nSee conda.\n"},"python/testing.html":{"url":"python/testing.html","title":"Testing","keywords":"","body":"Python testing\nIn general we use pytest for testing Python code.\nHere are a few guides to get you started writing tests: part 1, part 2, and part 3.\n"},"python/conventions.html":{"url":"python/conventions.html","title":"Conventions","keywords":"","body":"Conventions\n\nCode is read much more often than it is written. - A Wise Pythonista\n\nPEP8 and 💎 PEP20 (import this) should be considered as the starting points. Unless specified otherwise, we follow the guidelines laid out there. For a brief overview, read the Python Guide's entry on the subject.\n\nThe official guide has some very nice tips on code layout. This can be a nice reference when you are unsure about how to e.g. style your hanging indents.\n\nFuthermore, we use Python 3.6+. We encourage the use of type annotations (even if it doesn't cover 100% of your functions) and the new format strings:\nname = 'Paul Anderson'\nstring = f\"Hello {name}!\"\n\nIndentation\nUse 4 spaces to indent code. Never use hard tabs. Spaces are preferred over tabs for the following reason: spaces are spaces on every editor on every operating system. Tabs can be configured to act as 2, 4, 8 \"spaces\" and this can make code unreadable when being shared.\nMaximum line length: 100 chars\nLimit all lines to a maximum of 100 characters. Break down the line if it exceeds the maximum length. For example:\n# Python automatically concatenates consecutive strings\na_long_string = (\"I am a very long string that can be split across\"\n                 \"multiple lines by automatic string concatenation.\")\n\n# multi conditional if-statements can be split into multiple statements\n# notice how the code reads a lot like regular English!\nfirst_condition = 'genius' in 'Paul Thomas Anderson'\nsecond_condition = 'genius' in 'Daniel Day-Lewis'\n\nif first_condition and second_condition:\n    print('And the Oscar goes to... There Will Be Blood!')\n\nImports\nI like to split up imports into three separate groups: 1. standard library imports, 2. third party imports, 3. intra-package imports.\nimport os\nimport re\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom path import path\n\nfrom .utils import read_config\n\nFolders/packages\nA common folder structure for a Python projects looks like:\nmyPackage\n├── __init__.py\n├── exc.py                   \nThe important thing to note is how functionality is split up across the project. It's common that the same or similar functionality is available through many interfaces. For example it might be possible to list all recently added records in a database:\n\non the command line printed to the console\nover HTTP through a JSON API\nprogrammatically through accessing an API class\n\nThe cli package contains all command line related code and nothing more. Logic such as how to handle and report error messages to the user goes here. Avoid putting logic in CLI modules that directly handle things like manually filtering database queries. More generally think DRY - avoid doing the same thing manually in both CLI and server code. Always go through your Python API to interact with e.g. the database.\nCommand line interface (CLI)\nWe highly recommend implementing the CLI using Click. It has a very nice Pythonic interface for defining your interface and comes with helpers for reading input, printing colorful output, etc.\nLogging\nWe recommend using Coloredlogs which makes it super easy to enable logging for your package:\nimport coloredlogs\ncoloredlogs.install(level=log_level)\n\nRead more in the logging section\nServer\nIf it makes sense, a general app exposes a JSON API over HTTP(S). This API can then be consumed by a client side web app. Sometimes it makes sense to provide a the web interface as part of the Python package and other times it will be consumed by the central web portal interface.\nWe write our web servers in Flask which shares many similarities with Click. To connect to the store/backend we use Flask-Alchy.\nWe generally configure servers using environment variables which is a flexible and well supported option.\nStore\nWe start out with a SQL backend unless our needs require something different. We run all production SQL databases in MySQL. For development and testing it's often nice to work against a SQLite copy. For that reason and to make database interactions more pythonic, we make heavy use of the SQLAlchemy-wrapper, Alchy.\n\nNote that Alchy has been deprecated in favor of SQLService, however, we have not been able to successfully set up the latter package with Flask to work with the request context which is why we stay with Alchy for now.\n\nStore API\nAlchy shares the database connection with associated model classes. This allows you to perform queries by simply importing them like:\n# ... connect to database\nfrom trailblazer.store import models\n\nfor record in models.Sample.query:\n    print(record)\n\nHowever, this feels a little magic and it's not so clear how the model exactly got access to that database connection. Therefore, we advocate explicitly passing around an API class holding the database connection.\nfrom . import models\n\nclass DatabaseAPI():\n    Sample = models.Sample\n\n    def __init__(self, uri):\n        self.connect(uri)\n\n    def samples(self):\n        return self.Sample.query\n\nExceptions\nWe recommend that you base all your custom exceptions on a app-specific exception class. This way, 3-party packages that depend on it easily catch all exceptions from your package if they so choose.\nclass TrailblazerError(Exception):\n    def __init__(self, message):\n        self.message = message\n\nclass MissingFileError(TrailblazerError):\n    pass\n\nHelpful tools\nWe encourage using a linter to continuously check the syntax of your code. The Python community maintains a number of linters such as pep8, and PyFlakes.\nAnother resource that can greatly ease collaboration is EditorConfig. It's an effort to provide a cross editor configuration format and in placed in your project and committed to source control. You also need to install a plugin for your favorite editor, e.g. Sublime.\n"},"python/logging.html":{"url":"python/logging.html","title":"Logging","keywords":"","body":"Logging\nLogging is the logical next step when you realize the limitations of printing. Python includes a very useful logging module in the standard library so it's rather easy to get started. First make sure you know the basics. Now when you want to log some progress or program state in a module:\nimport logging\n\nLOG = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n\ndef foo(bar):\n    \"\"\"My fancy function.\"\"\"\n    LOG.info(\"incrementing the input: %s\", bar)\n    return bar + 1\n\nThe not-so-intuitive part is that you need to configure the logging module to see any output from these calls. Luckily we can reduce the setup to a simple function call most of the time using the coloredlogs package. During e.g. your CLI initialization include:\nimport click\nimport coloredlogs\nimport logging\n\nLOG = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n@click.command()\n@click.option('-l', '--log-level', default='INFO', help='Log message level to display')\ndef cli(log_level):\n    \"\"\"Base command line entry point.\"\"\"\n    coloredlogs.install(level=log_level)\n    LOG.info(\"Running cli\")\n    # ... more code here\n\n"},"python/count_variants/overview.html":{"url":"python/count_variants/overview.html","title":"Creating a Python projekt","keywords":"","body":"Creating a Python package\nTo be able to reuse code it is important to package the things we are doing in a way that makes them easy to install and operate.\nThere are of course a number of ways to handle this situation and we will describe our prefered way to do it here.\nI will use an example as we go along, we are going to create a package called count_variants that is used to count variants with different selection criterias in a [VCF][vcf] file.\nIn this example we will tie together many of the topics described in this guide, like testing, conventions, git, logging and perhaps some more.\nOverview\n\n1.

Its major features are that it's easy to use, supports both procedural and object-oriented (OO) programming, has powerful built-in support for text processing, and has one of the world's most impressive collections of third-party modules.\nA good place to start learning what perl is about is the perlintro at perldocs.\n"},"perl/best_practises/best_practises.html":{"url":"perl/best_practises/best_practises.html","title":"Best Practices","keywords":"","body":"Perl Best Practices\nFollowing best practices is a good way to create maintainable and readable code and should always be encouraged. However, learning what these best practices are and when they apply in the context of your code can be hard to determine. Luckily, there are several tools to help guide you on your way. \nLiterature\nWe have already mentioned perldocs.\nDamian Conway's book Perl Best Practices is a very good reference.\nCode standards\nPerl Critic\nPerlcritic is a Perl source code analyzer. It is the executable front-end to the Perl::Critic engine, which attempts to identify awkward, hard to read, error-prone, or unconventional constructs in your code. Most of the rules are based on Damian Conway's book Perl Best Practices.\nPerl critic allows different degrees of severity. Severity values are integers ranging from 1 (least severe) to 5 (most severe) when analyzing your code. You can also use the severity names if you think it hard to remember the meaning of the integers (1 = brutal and 5 = gentle). The level is controlled with the '--severity' flag. There is also a verbose flag, to print more information about the identified deviations from the perl critic best practises. There are 11 levels of verbosity.\nExamples\nperlcritic --severity 4 --verbose 11 my_perl_script.pl\nPerl critic also has web interface to instantly analyze your code. \nPerl Tidy\nPerltidy is a Perl script which indents and reformats Perl scripts to make them easier to read. If you write Perl scripts, or spend much time reading them, you will probably find it useful. Perltidy is an excellent way to automate the code standardisation with minimum of effort.  \nExamples\nperltidy somefile.pl\nThis will produce a file somefile.pl.tdy containing the script reformatted using the default options, which approximate the style suggested in perlstyle(1). The source file somefile.pl is unchanged.\nperltidy -b -bext='/' file1.pl file2.pl\nCreate backups of files and modify files in place. The backup files file1.pl.bak and file2.pl.bak will be deleted if there are no errors.\n"},"perl/best_practises/Identifiers.html":{"url":"perl/best_practises/Identifiers.html","title":"Identifiers","keywords":"","body":"Identifiers\nThe single most important practice when creating names is to devise a set of grammar rules to which all names must conform. A grammar rules specifies one or more templates (e.g., Noun :: Adjective :: Adjective) that describe how to form the entity on the left of the arrow (e.g., namespace).\nA suitable grammar rule for naming packages and classes is:\nnamespace ➝  Noun :: Adjective :: Adjective\n           | Noun :: Adjective\n           | Noun\nThis rule might produce package names such as:\n package Disk;\n package Disk::Audio;\n package Disk::DVD;\n package Disk::DVD::Rewritable;\nIn this scheme, specialized versions of an existing namespace are named by adding adjectives to the name of the more general namespace.\nVariables should be named according to the data they will store, and as specifically as possible. Variables that are used in more than one block should always have a two-part (or longer) name.\nA variable is named with a noun, preceded by zero or more adjectives:\nvariable ➝ [adjective _ ]* noun\nThe choice of nouns and adjectives is critical. The nouns in particular should indicate what the variable does in terms of the problem domain, not in terms of the implementation. Use adjectives whenever you can.\nThere is one extra grammatical variation that applies only to hashes and arrays that are used as look-up tables:\nlookup_variable ➝ [adjective _ ]* noun preposition\nAdding a preposition to the end of the name makes hash and array accesses much more readable.\nmy %title_of;\nmy @sales_from;\nFor subroutines and methods, a suitable grammatical rule for forming names is:\nroutine ➝  imperative_verb [ _ adjective]? _ noun _ preposition\n         | imperative_verb [ _ adjective]? _ noun _ participle\n         | imperative_verb [ _ adjective]? _ noun\nThis rule results in subroutine names such as:\nsub get_record;                         # imperative_verb noun\nsub get_record_for;                     # imperative_verb noun preposition\nsub eat_cookie;                         # imperative_verb noun\nsub eat_previous_cookie;                # imperative_verb adjective noun\nsub build_profile;                      # imperative_verb noun\nsub build_execution_profile;            # imperative_verb adjective noun\nsub build_execution_profile_using;      # imperative_verb adjective noun participle\nThese naming rules particularly the two that put participles or prepositions at the ends of names create identifiers that read far more naturally, often eliminating the need for any additional comments.\n"},"editors/":{"url":"editors/","title":"Editors","keywords":"","body":"Editors\nChoosing an editor is a person and highly subjective decision.

First module \nOk so finally we can start to write some actual python code! In this section we will learn about file structure, imports and a little bit about command line interfaces.\nWhen we finnish this section we should have a small program that counts the number of variants in a vcf.\nWe will try to keep the code separated inside our projekt as described here, we store the counting code in a submodule called utils and the cli code in a module called cli. So run:\n$ mkdir count_variants/cli count_variants/cli\n$ touch count_variants/cli/__init__.py\n$ touch count_variants/utils/__init__.py\n$ touch count_variants/cli/root.py\n$ touch count_variants/utils/count.py\n\nOk a lot of files created here, the __init__.py files we know from before, they are there to tell that this is a module.\ncount_variants/cli/root.py will include the command line interface to our program and count_variants/utils/count.py will include the code that counts vcf variants.\n3.1 Writing the first function \nOpen count_variants/utils/count.py and write the following\n\ndef count_variants(vcf):\n    \"\"\"Count the number of variants in a vcf file\n\n    Args:\n        vcf(iterable): An iterable with variants\n\n    Returns:\n        nr_variants(int): Number of variants in file\n    \"\"\"\n    nr_variants = 0\n    for variant in vcf:\n        nr_variants += 1\n\n    return nr_variants\n\nThe text within quotation marks is a docstring, EVERY function you write should have a docstring that at least explains what the intention of the function is and input and output.\n3.2 Writing the CLI \nNow open count_variants/cli/root.py and write:\nimport logging\n\nimport click\nimport coloredlogs\n\nfrom cyvcf2 import VCF\n\nfrom count_variants.utils.count import count_variants\n\nLOG = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n\n@click.command()\n@click.argument('vcf', type=click.Path(exists=True))\ndef cli(vcf):\n    \"\"\"Count the variants in a vcf\"\"\"\n    coloredlogs.install(level='INFO')\n    LOG.info(\"Reading vcf file: %s\", vcf)\n\n    vcf_obj = VCF(vcf)\n\n    nr_variants = count_variants(vcf_obj)\n\n    click.echo(\"Nr variants in vcf: %s\", nr_variants)\n\nIt is a good convention to import standard library modules first, then third party modules and finally local imports.\nIn this case we will go through the code line by line.\n\nlogging is the standard library solution for logging in python.\nclick is our prefered package to buiild command line interfaces.\ncoloredlogs is a wrapper for logging that makes logging look good and super easy.\ncyvcf2 is a reliable and fast parser for VCF files\ncount_variants.utils.count on this line we import the function that we root in the previous section\nLOG = logging.getLogger(__name__) here we create a logging object and name it LOG\n@click.command() is a decorator, you do not need to understand the concept right now. It basically give the following function some properties\n@click.argument() this is how a argument is defined in click\n\nThen comes the function definition, the docstring and some code that should be rather straight forward.\n3.3 Missing modules\nThe modules in standard library follows with the python distribution so there is no need to install those. As you may have noticed there are some modules used here that are missing in our requirements.txt file. It can be a bit hard to know what third party modules that will be used when starting a project. So lets add coloredlogs and cyvcf2 to requirements.txt, when you are done it should look like:\n$ cat requirements.txt\nclick\ncoloredlogs\ncyvcf2\n\n\nIf everything is done correct the folder structure should look like this now:\n"}}}
