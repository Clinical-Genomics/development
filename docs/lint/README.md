# Linting

Linting is a reporting tool for improving source code one step at a time.

Often times enforcing coding styles to an existing project can be a nightmare. Some reasons may include:

- the codebase is already a mess and the output of the tools is overwhelming.
- developers don't feel confident changing lines they do not own.
- or they just don't know what tool to use.

Most of the languages already have a suggested style code, which can be looked up, and now can be automatically checked!

You can check how to lint your code for python and bash, and how you can automate linting with the help of TravisCI.
