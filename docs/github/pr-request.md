# How to request a pull request review

After you create a pull request, you can ask a specific person to review the changes you've proposed. If you're an organization member, you can also request a specific team to review your changes. The requested reviewer or team will receive a notification that you asked them to review the pull request.

Once someone has reviewed your pull request and you've made the necessary changes, you can re-request review from the same reviewer. If the requested reviewer does not submit a review, and the pull request meets the repository's mergeability requirements, you can still merge the pull request, if needed.

1. Under your repository name, click **Pull requests**.
   ![Issues and pull requests tab selection][pull request selection]
1. In the list of pull requests, click the pull request that you'd like to ask a specific person or a team to review.
1. Navigate to **Reviewers** in the right sidebar.
1. To request a review from a suggested person under **Reviewers**, next to their username, click **Request**.
   ![Reviewers request icon in the right sidebar][reviewer request]
1. Optionally, to request a review from someone other than a suggested person, click **Reviewers**, then click on a name or a team in the dropdown menu.

1. Optionally, if you know the name of the person or team you'd like a review from, click **Reviewers**, then type the username of the person or the name of the team you're asking to review your changes. Click their team name or username to request a review.
