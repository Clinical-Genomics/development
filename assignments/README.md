# Assignments

These small tasks are designed to introduce employees to how we work with code. It tests some essential skills and is also great for practice!

## 1: Git, GitHub, and Markdown

These are all essential skills in the modern developer toolbox.

- **Git** is our version control system. It's abundant in use in the industry and knowing it well is vital for collaborating and writing code.
- **GitHub** is a central Git-server which makes collaborating with code easy. We use it to store all our code. GitHub hosts an impressive amount of open source software and is something you should be intimately familiar with!
- **Markdown** is the go to markup language for authoring documentation, comments, websites, and more. Markdown let's you write documents in plain text without worrying about the formatting - great for productivity! It's another core tool that you want to make friends with ðŸ˜„

### The exercise

The exercise consists of creating a page in the Development repo. Pick a topic that you want to share (or learn) something about - if you need ideas, have a look at this issue: [Topic to cover][topics].

#### Steps to complete the exercise

1. Find the "development" repository on GitHub (Organization: Clinical-Genomics)
2. Clone the repo locally
3. Make a branch based off the master branch and name it something relevant like: "add-info-about-logging"
4. Create a new folder in the root of the directory and add a "README.md" file in it
5. Modify the contents using Markdown
    - here's a [quick guide][quick-markdown] and a nice [cheat-sheet][cheat-markdown]
    - don't worry too much about what to right here ðŸ˜‰
6. Commit the changes with an informative commit message
7. Push/publish the new branch to GitHub
8. Go to GitHub and open a pull request from your branch
    - Explain what your have done in the Markdown input box
9. @-mention a team member to review your code!

If you at any point run into a step you don't fully understand and find difficult to complete, don't hesitate to reach out to one of your colleagues - they will be more than happy to help out! ðŸ‘Œ
