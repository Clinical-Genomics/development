Introduction Conda is a package, dependency and environment manager for any language. Conda actually consists of Anaconda and a smaller version called Miniconda. Miniconda is usually sufficient most of the time, but you can also install anaconda from miniconda using: $ conda create -n test_ananconda anaconda The conda command is the primary interface for managing installations of various packages and environments. 2. Environments A conda environment is a directory that contains a specific collection of conda packages that you have installed. If you change one environment, your other environments are not affected. Condas default environment is called base or root. To create an environment, run: $ conda create --name [environment] You can easily activate or deactivate environments, which is how you switch between them. To activate an environment, run: $ source activate [environment] Conda puts an asterisk (*) in front of the active environment. You can view your environments with: $ conda info --envs or $ conda env list Your active environment will also show in front of your prompt: (my_env) $ To deactivate your current environment: $ source deactivate You can copy your environment by: $ conda create --name [environment] --clone [copy_of_environment] You can also share your environment with someone by giving them a copy of your environment.yaml file. To remove an environment, run: $ conda remove --name [environment] --all 3. Packages A conda package is a compressed tarball file that contains system-level libraries, Python or other modules, executable programs and other components. Conda keeps track of the dependencies between packages and platforms. Conda packages are downloaded from remote channels, which are URLs to directories containing conda packages. The conda command searches a default set of channels, and packages are automatically downloaded and updated from a central repository. To install conda packages in your active environment (default or other), run: $ conda install [packagename_1] [packagename_2] To install conda packages in an environment, run: $ conda install --name [environemnt] [packagename_1] [packagename_2] It is also possible to create a new environment and install packages at the same time $ conda create --name [environment] [packagename] To list all packages in a conda environment, run: $ conda list --name [environment] To remove a package, run: $ conda remove --name [packagename] 3.1 Versions To install or change a specific version of a package use the syntax [packagename]=[version]. $ conda install samtools=1.6.0 vt=170135","title":"Conda"},{"location":"conda/#conda","text":"Introduction Environments Packages Version","title":"Conda"},{"location":"conda/#1-introduction","text":"Conda is a package, dependency and environment manager for any language.

Download and setup Download and install Git for Linux If you are working on a Debian-based version of Linux you can install the basic Git tools via APT: sudo apt-get install git-all Here are instructions on how to install Git under other Linux distributions. Download and install Git for OSX The latest version of Git for Mac can be downloaded here , use this binary installer to get an up-to date version of he software. If you are installing on a Mac with OS X 10.9 you can install Git from command line with Homebrew (get Homebrew here ) by typing: brew install git Configure username and email The first time you are using git from command line you should set up a username and a password. To ease the authentication for each action, go to your local repository and type in the following commands: git config user.email \"you@example.com\" git config user.name \"YourUsername\" If you are working locally (your computer only), you could also add the --global flag to set these values for all your repositories. Create a new repository There are several ways how one can create a new local repository Create a new repository from scratch Create a directory with the name of the new repository and enter it from the command line. To initialize the repository type: git init This command will create a .git subfolder. Clone a repository from a project in the clinical-genomics GitHub organisation git clone https://github.com/clinical-genomics/development.git Where the url which can be obtained from the web page of your local fork, by clicking on the \"clone or download\" green button. The git clone command then creates a folder with the project and pulls the latest data from your fork in it. Clone any other repository When you are contributing to an existing repository, the first thing you should do is forking this repository to your github space. A fork is basically a copy of the original project, on which you can experiment as much as you want without changing the original project. how to fork a repository Then clone your fork. git clone https://github.com/[your user name]/development.git Keep your fork up to date Before committing and pushing changes to your remote repository you should check that you are working on an updated version of it. To update your fork follow these instructions: First you need to get the latest version of the original project you forked from. To do so, from command line move to the main folder containing your project and type: git remote add upstream path/to/repo/you/forked/from git fetch upstream git pull upstream master git pull upstream develop # develop is the version you start from for your work! You don't have to call the remote \"upstream\" but you can chose any name for it. To visualize all remotes you are working with and their respective shortnames use the command: git remote -v To remove remotes instead, use the command \"git remove rm\": git remote rm name_of_remote After pulling data from the remote your local copy of the repo should be up-to-date with the upstream. Now you need to update your fork (the copy existing online, in GitHub) accordingly. If you wish to update you master branch on your fork, for instance, you'd type these commands: # be sure to place yourself in your master branch git checkout master git rebase upstream/master git push You use the same commands to update any other branch of your forked repository. Git data transport structure and commands The following image shows the structure of the git commands and spaces: Your workspace is the folder that holds the actual working files while the \"index\" is the space is a staging area where you add your changes before committing them to the local repository or \"head\". To send the changes to your remote repository you use the \"push\" command. Here is a link to a page explaining the common Git terminology: https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary Create a new branch or feature for your work To create a new branch, from command line move to the main folder containing your project and type: git checkout -b name_of_your_feature develop If everything went fine then you'll get the following message: \"Switched to a new branch name_of_your_feature\". This means you are already inside the new feature. To make sure that you are in the right branch type: git branch Whenever you want to move to another branch/feature the command is: git checkout [my-topic] Make changes and commit them to your local repository Before committing any changes to your local repository, and finally to the remote repository, make sure you were working on the branch created. After you are satisfied with your code you can start to commit to the remote repository. To check that there are actually changes to add and commit, type: git status This command will give you info on the status of your working directory comparing it with the local and remote repositories. To update the local repository to the latest status, by fetchin and merging remote changes, type: git pull The you can start adding your changes to the index with the command: git add filename_to_send_to_index The process of adding a file to the index is also called staging. Be sure to add all the files you want to include to the index. Before merging the changes you can preview them with the command: git diff source_branch target_branch Calling the \"diff\" command without arguments will list all the differences between the index and your workspace, i.e. all the files that you could add to the index. To commit changes from the index to the local repository (HEAD), type: git commit Alternatively you can add and commit the files to the local repository in only one command: git commit -a NOTE: Be very careful with the above command, since it gives you less control over the single steps of the workflow and the files you really want to commit. Before using it, make sure everything is under control by using the \"git status\" and \"git diff\" commands. Prevent commiting tmp files your editor makes! To include a description of the commit use the -m flag git commit -m \"Example of a commit message\" It is possible to close a GitHub issue by referencing it in a commit message or pull request. The issue will be closed when the code is merged to the default branch git commit -m \"Fixes #36\" For more examples on how to close issues using keywords see this guide . Pushing changes to your remote repository After \"git add\" and \"git commit\", or \"commit -a\", your changes are in the HEAD of your local repository. To send them to the remote repository use the command \"push\": git push Create a pull request to the parent repository You create a \"pull request\" when you want to propose the introduction of your changes to the repository where your project was cloned or forked from. Pull requests are created on github on the page of the github repository. By default pull requests are directed to the default branch (master). For a more detailed explanation of pull requests visit the Github help page. Once the pull request is merged and closed you can safely remove the branch you've been working on. To remove a generic branch both remotely and locally type: git branch -d name_of_your_branch #removes it locally git push origin --delete name_of_your_branch #removes it remotely It is possible to close a GitHub issue by referencing it in a pull request title or description, e.g. \"Fixes #46\". The issue will be closed when the code is merged to the default branch. A more in-depth description can be found in this guide .

This can be a nice reference when you are unsure about how to e.g. style your hanging indents. Futhermore, we use Python 3.6+. We encourage the use of type annotations (even if it doesn't cover 100% of your functions) and the new format strings: name = 'Paul Anderson' string = f\"Hello {name}!\" Indentation Use 4 spaces to indent code. Never use hard tabs. Spaces are preferred over tabs for the following reason: spaces are spaces on every editor on every operating system. Tabs can be configured to act as 2, 4, 8 \"spaces\" and this can make code unreadable when being shared. Maximum line length: 100 chars Limit all lines to a maximum of 100 characters. Break down the line if it exceeds the maximum length. For example: # Python automatically concatenates consecutive strings a_long_string = (\"I am a very long string that can be split across\" \"multiple lines by automatic string concatenation.\") # multi conditional if-statements can be split into multiple statements # notice how the code reads a lot like regular English! first_condition = 'genius' in 'Paul Thomas Anderson' second_condition = 'genius' in 'Daniel Day-Lewis' if first_condition and second_condition: print('And the Oscar goes to...

It's common that the same or similar functionality is available through many interfaces. For example it might be possible to list all recently added records in a database: on the command line printed to the console over HTTP through a JSON API programmatically through accessing an API class The cli package contains all command line related code and nothing more. Logic such as how to handle and report error messages to the user goes here. Avoid putting logic in CLI modules that directly handle things like manually filtering database queries. More generally think DRY - avoid doing the same thing manually in both CLI and server code. Always go through your Python API to interact with e.g. the database. Command line interface (CLI) We highly recommend implementing the CLI using Click . It has a very nice Pythonic interface for defining your interface and comes with helpers for reading input, printing colorful output, etc. Logging We recommend using Coloredlogs which makes it super easy to enable logging for your package: import coloredlogs coloredlogs.install(level=log_level) Read more in the logging section Server If it makes sense, a general app exposes a JSON API over HTTP(S). This API can then be consumed by a client side web app. Sometimes it makes sense to provide a the web interface as part of the Python package and other times it will be consumed by the central web portal interface. We write our web servers in Flask which shares many similarities with Click . To connect to the store/backend we use Flask-Alchy . We generally configure servers using environment variables which is a flexible and well supported option. Store We start out with a SQL backend unless our needs require something different. We run all production SQL databases in MySQL. For development and testing it's often nice to work against a SQLite copy. For that reason and to make database interactions more pythonic, we make heavy use of the SQLAlchemy-wrapper, Alchy . Note that Alchy has been deprecated in favor of SQLService, however, we have not been able to successfully set up the latter package with Flask to work with the request context which is why we stay with Alchy for now. Store API Alchy shares the database connection with associated model classes. This allows you to perform queries by simply importing them like: # ... connect to database from trailblazer.store import models for record in models.Sample.query: print(record) However, this feels a little magic and it's not so clear how the model exactly got access to that database connection. Therefore, we advocate explicitly passing around an API class holding the database connection. from . import models class DatabaseAPI(): Sample = models.Sample def __init__(self, uri): self.connect(uri) def samples(self): return self.Sample.query Exceptions We recommend that you base all your custom exceptions on a app-specific exception class. This way, 3-party packages that depend on it easily catch all exceptions from your package if they so choose. class TrailblazerError(Exception): def __init__(self, message): self.message = message class MissingFileError(TrailblazerError): pass Helpful tools We encourage using a linter to continuously check the syntax of your code.

TestPyPI is a test site where you can verify that the software package is ok before uploading it to the official PyPI repository. To handle these accounts and use the same settings for every submission to PyPI you'll do in the future, you could create a .pypirc file in your home directory. This file should contain the following lines: [distutils] index-servers = pypi testpypi [pypi] username = your pypi username password = your pypi password [testpypi] repository = https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ username = your testpypi username password = your testpypi password Otherwise you could always specify repository name, user and password every time you upload a package. This latter would be the safest option because this way you'd be avoiding storing passwords in plaintext in your home directory. After packaging your software as described here , you are ready to upload it to the Python Package Index (PyPI), a repository specific for Python software. Be sure that all files that have to be included in the package along with with the code are listed in the manifest file (MANIFEST.in). It is necessary for instance to include files such as requirements.txt and LICENSE.txt. Please note that markdown-formatted pages are rendered poorly on the PyPI web pages, so you might want to convert the README.md file to reStructuredText format (.rst). This can be done by using Pandoc . Next step of preparing your package for PyPI would be fixing the setup.py file to include a download_url link to a tarball url. According to the official documentation available on packaging.python.org, packages version should follow the flexible public version scheme specified in PEP 440 . Some examples: 1.2.0.dev1 # Development release 1.2.0a1 # Alpha Release 1.2.0b1 # Beta Release 1.2.0rc1 # Release Candidate 1.2.0 # Final Release 1.2.0.post1 # Post Release 15.10 # Date based release 23 # Serial release is link should be taking into account the version number of the software. If for instance the version of your software is 1.3.0, the setup.py file should be modified by adding this line: setup( ... download_url = 'https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/Name_of_your_package/tarball/1.3.0', ... ) Note that this url doesn't exist yet and will be created at a later stage. After committing this change and fixing this version of the repository you should add a git tag to the package. This commands adds basically a version number and release to the project and will be showed under the \"releases\" page of the git project. The syntax to add a tag is the following: git tag 1.3.0 -m \"Added a 1.3.0 version tag for PyPI\" git push --tags origin master Next step consists in creating a distribution release of the package. If your package has different requirements under different platforms (Linux, Mac or Windows) you should create platform wheels to taking care of this issue. Here's a documentation page explaining how to create wheel files . If you don't need to care about wheels instead you can just create a distribution using the setup file: python setup.py sdist After creating a distribution you can test the upload on test.pypi. To do the actual upload you'll need twine (pip install twine if it isn't installed already). Upload to test.pypi: twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/* Check now that your repository is on PyPI test, under \"your packages\". You could now attempt to install the package from pip. To do that type: pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple name_of_package The \"--extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple\" option would instruct pip to retrieve all dependencies for your package from pypi itself. If your package can be found on the test repository and everything is as you expect, it is safe to upload it on the PyPI repository: twine upload --repository-url https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/* Your package should be now available for installation over internet by using the command \"pip install your_package\".","title":"Uploading a Python package to PyPI"},{"location":"python/uploading_to_pypi/#uploading-a-python-package-to-pypi","text":"First thing to do is registering a user account on both TestPyPI and PyPI . TestPyPI is a test site where you can verify that the software package is ok before uploading it to the official PyPI repository. To handle these accounts and use the same settings for every submission to PyPI you'll do in the future, you could create a .pypirc file in your home directory. This file should contain the following lines: [distutils] index-servers = pypi testpypi [pypi] username = your pypi username password = your pypi password [testpypi] repository = https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ username = your testpypi username password = your testpypi password Otherwise you could always specify repository name, user and password every time you upload a package. This latter would be the safest option because this way you'd be avoiding storing passwords in plaintext in your home directory. After packaging your software as described here , you are ready to upload it to the Python Package Index (PyPI), a repository specific for Python software. Be sure that all files that have to be included in the package along with with the code are listed in the manifest file (MANIFEST.in). It is necessary for instance to include files such as requirements.txt and LICENSE.txt. Please note that markdown-formatted pages are rendered poorly on the PyPI web pages, so you might want to convert the README.md file to reStructuredText format (.rst). This can be done by using Pandoc . Next step of preparing your package for PyPI would be fixing the setup.py file to include a download_url link to a tarball url. According to the official documentation available on packaging.python.org, packages version should follow the flexible public version scheme specified in PEP 440 . Some examples: 1.2.0.dev1 # Development release 1.2.0a1 # Alpha Release 1.2.0b1 # Beta Release 1.2.0rc1 # Release Candidate 1.2.0 # Final Release 1.2.0.post1 # Post Release 15.10 # Date based release 23 # Serial release is link should be taking into account the version number of the software. If for instance the version of your software is 1.3.0, the setup.py file should be modified by adding this line: setup( ... download_url = 'https://github.com/Clinical-Genomics/Name_of_your_package/tarball/1.3.0', ... ) Note that this url doesn't exist yet and will be created at a later stage. After committing this change and fixing this version of the repository you should add a git tag to the package. This commands adds basically a version number and release to the project and will be showed under the \"releases\" page of the git project. The syntax to add a tag is the following: git tag 1.3.0 -m \"Added a 1.3.0 version tag for PyPI\" git push --tags origin master Next step consists in creating a distribution release of the package.

Each module in the package must have a file called __init__.py to tell python that this is a module. From the documentation The init .py files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later (deeper) on the module search path. In the simplest case, init .py can just be an empty file, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the all variable, described later. mkdir count_variants touch count_variants/__init__.py touch count_variants/__version__.py open count_variants/__version__.py and write: __version__ = '0.1.0' The folder structure should now look like: count_variants/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 LICENSE \u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md \u251c\u2500\u2500 MANIFEST.in \u251c\u2500\u2500 .gitignore \u251c\u2500\u2500 setup.py \u251c\u2500\u2500 count_variants/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py \u251c\u2500\u2500 __version__.py Add all the new files to a new git commit.
