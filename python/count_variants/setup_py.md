# 2. setup.py

Every python package contains a special file called `setup.py ` in the root directory. This file describes some meta information about the package and how to create a distribution.
There is a excellent guide for how to setup a package and create the setup.py [here][setup_guide].
Lets continue with our example following @kennethreitz guide, please read the guide first.

Copy `setup.py` from the guide and open it, if you do it right it should look like:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

# Note: To use the 'upload' functionality of this file, you must:
#   $ pip install twine

import io
import os
import sys
from shutil import rmtree

from setuptools import find_packages, setup, Command

# Package meta-data.
NAME = 'mypackage'
DESCRIPTION = 'My short description for my project. '
URL = 'https://github.com/me/myproject'
EMAIL = 'me@example.com'
AUTHOR = 'Awesome Soul'

# What packages are required for this module to be executed?
REQUIRED = [
    # 'requests', 'maya', 'records',
]

# The rest you shouldn't have to touch too much :)
# ------------------------------------------------
# Except, perhaps the License and Trove Classifiers!
# If you do change the License, remember to change the Trove Classifier for that!

here = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))

# Import the README and use it as the long-description.
# Note: this will only work if 'README.rst' is present in your MANIFEST.in file!
with io.open(os.path.join(here, 'README.rst'), encoding='utf-8') as f:
    long_description = '\n' + f.read()

# Load the package's __version__.py module as a dictionary.
about = {}
with open(os.path.join(here, NAME, '__version__.py')) as f:
    exec(f.read(), about)


class UploadCommand(Command):
    """Support setup.py upload."""

    description = 'Build and publish the package.'
    user_options = []

    @staticmethod
    def status(s):
        """Prints things in bold."""
        print('\033[1m{0}\033[0m'.format(s))

    def initialize_options(self):
        pass

    def finalize_options(self):
        pass

    def run(self):
        try:
            self.status('Removing previous builds…')
            rmtree(os.path.join(here, 'dist'))
        except OSError:
            pass

        self.status('Building Source and Wheel (universal) distribution…')
        os.system('{0} setup.py sdist bdist_wheel --universal'.format(sys.executable))

        self.status('Uploading the package to PyPi via Twine…')
        os.system('twine upload dist/*')

        sys.exit()


# Where the magic happens:
setup(
    name=NAME,
    version=about['__version__'],
    description=DESCRIPTION,
    long_description=long_description,
    author=AUTHOR,
    author_email=EMAIL,
    url=URL,
    packages=find_packages(exclude=('tests',)),
    # If your package is a single module, use this instead of 'packages':
    # py_modules=['mypackage'],

    # entry_points={
    #     'console_scripts': ['mycli=mymodule:cli'],
    # },
    install_requires=REQUIRED,
    include_package_data=True,
    license='MIT',
    classifiers=[
        # Trove classifiers
        # Full list: https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=list_classifiers
        'License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License',
        'Programming Language :: Python',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 2.6',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 2.7',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.3',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.4',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.5',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: 3.6',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: Implementation :: CPython',
        'Programming Language :: Python :: Implementation :: PyPy'
    ],
    # $ setup.py publish support.
    cmdclass={
        'upload': UploadCommand,
    },
)
```

We will now edit the file so to follow our package. We are going to change the *name* of our package, the *author name* and *description*. Since we keep our requirements in a special file we are going to edit how to tell `setup.py` about those. We will also change `README.rst` to `README.md`. When you are done the file should look like:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

# Note: To use the 'upload' functionality of this file, you must:
#   $ pip install twine

import io
import os
import sys
from shutil import rmtree

def parse_reqs(req_path='./requirements.txt'):
    """Recursively parse requirements from nested pip files."""
    install_requires = []
    with io.open(os.path.join(here, 'requirements.txt'), encoding='utf-8') as handle:
        # remove comments and empty lines
        lines = (line.strip() for line in handle
                 if line.strip() and not line.startswith('#'))

        for line in lines:
            # check for nested requirements files
            if line.startswith('-r'):
                # recursively call this function
                install_requires += parse_reqs(req_path=line[3:])

            else:
                # add the line as a new requirement
                install_requires.append(line)

    return install_requires

    ],
    # $ setup.py publish support.
    cmdclass={
        'upload': UploadCommand,
    },
)
```

Now we are about to add the directory where we will write the actual python code.
Each module in the package must have a file called `__init__.py` to tell python that this is a module.
From the [documentation][init_doc]

> The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent directories with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid modules that occur later (deeper) on the module search path. In the simplest case, __init__.py can just be an empty file, but it can also execute initialization code for the package or set the __all__ variable, described later.

```bash
mkdir count_variants
touch count_variants/__init__.py
touch count_variants/__version__.py
```

open `count_variants/__version__.py` and write:

```python
__version__ = '0.1.0'
```

The folder structure should now look like:

```bash
count_variants/
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── MANIFEST.in
├── .gitignore
├── setup.py
├── count_variants/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── __version__.py
```

Add all the new files to a new git commit. (Tip: use `git status` to see if all files are committed.)
