# Editors

Choosing an editor is a person and highly subjective decision. We don't advocate any particular flavor but here are a few competent ones that we recommend you start with:

- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- Vim, GVim, [MACVim](https://github.com/macvim-dev/macvim) etc.
- [Textmate](https://github.com/textmate/textmate)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
